Fork of standard library code, started as a backport of Python ftplib from 2.7
to 2.5.

This is a quick and dirty port.
pyOpenSSL is used instead of the standard ssl module.

On top of the port, a few extra functionalities were added;

* Add support for FTPS CCC
* Add support for Implicit FTPS
* Allow explicit usage of extended commands.
* Raise an explicit error if command channel was not properly closed.
* Allow using an explicit cipher list.
* Allow using an explicit SSL/TLS method.
* Allow checking server identity.

This code is `experimental` and is used to support our automated functional
tests.
